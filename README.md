# CTF B.Archiver
---

Archiver for CTF site, brought to u by BASH.

_this couldn't be possible without KKTan from CSIT_

### Why do you need this?

Was Nik's CTF challenges too difficult for you? 

Was the CTF too short?

Is the CTF infrastructure going down too soon?

Or maybe your brain too smooth and you didn't manage to solve any challenge?

**WORRY NOT**. 

We introduce to you our very own ~~**FLEXTAPE**~~ **CTF.SG Scraper/Archiver**, written specially in BASH!!

_what bash???_ YES BASH. THAT BASH. THE COMMAND LINE LANGUAGE YOU USE IN LINUX.

---

### Usage

Simply download the **barchiver.sh** script attached to this repo.

Run the script with **./basharchiver.sh**. 

_PROFIT_
